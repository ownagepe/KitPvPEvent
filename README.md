# KitPvPEvent
An Infection + Last Man Standing Event plugin written for OwnagePE

## If you want to run/use this plugin youll need:
- A minimum of 4 players
- World named `WaitingZone`, players will spawn in this before event start
- World named `CaveMap`, this is where the plugin will think the Infection event is hosted
- World named `FPS`, this is where the plugin will try host the LastManStanding Event.

## Disclaimer
- If your unable to use it or it has issues its not my problem as it ran smoothly on a server with 100 players online.
- If you are able to make use of the plugin then nice.
